# ML-Interface

Using this project on the firms that I give consultations.


It came from very long road and it is written very fastly and poorly.


Because the codebase and the project is terrible I am refacting it.


This is just bunch of ml algorithms come together with a tkinter backend.


## What is needed to be done

- [] Separate backend from frontend

### Frontend

- [] Create input component
- [] Create validation component
- [] Create preprocess data component
- [] Create model component
- [] Create predict component

### Backend

- [] Create preprocessing functionality
- [] Create saving functionality
- [] Create loading functionality
- [] Create training functionality
- [] Create prediction functionality
- [] Create some tests
